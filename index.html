      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
          Versatile full-stack developer. Very passionate for creating things 
          and I value the development process. Looking forward to working with
          all types of systems so I can adapt my experience and apply what I've
          learned to them. Quick on my feet in terms of learning new
          technologies and keen enough with computer systems to quickly troubleshoot problems. 
          I am the current Vice President of STACC, our computer science club on campus. Excited
          to be involved with most computer science and technology fields, though I am mainly interested
          in Software Development.
